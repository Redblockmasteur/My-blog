# **W**elcome to **the github for my portfolio**

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio, which is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The site is accessible at this address: [chatelain.dev](https://www.chatelain.dev/)

Please note that while the interface is primarily in French, the articles are mainly written in English.

## Project Structure and Enhancements

The foundation of this project is based on the work by pixegami, which can be found on his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pixegami/nextjs-blog-tutorial).

In addition to the basic structure, I've incorporated a few enhancements:

1. **Language Indicator:** Articles now include an emoji indicator, providing a quick visual cue about the language in which they are written.

* **Article Filtering:** Articles are displayed based on their publication dates rather than alphabetically. This allows you to easily stay updated with my latest work, without having to sift through older content.

Feel free to explore the code and leave any suggestions or feedback. Thank you for visiting!
