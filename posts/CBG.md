In a delightful twist of fate that connected my heritage with my future, I spent the summer of 2023 not among the hum of servers and screens, but within the vibrant and peaceful expanse of the Chicago Botanic Garden. I am a computer science student, an aspiring tech enthusiast, and come from a family with deep roots in farming and nursery operations. So when the opportunity to volunteer at one of the largest botanical gardens in the United States presented itself, I couldn't miss it. The idea of reconnecting with my agricultural heritage while simultaneously exploring the potential of technology in this field seemed too compelling to pass.

### My Journey Across Gardens

My volunteer work began at the Japanese Garden where I honed my skills in caring for cloud pines through the techniques of candling and pine cone removal. I also delved into the delicate process of moss garden maintenance.

My journey then led me to Evening Island, my first exposure to lakeshore management, where I worked to control the marsh spurge population by removing seed heads.

At the Shade and Sun Evaluation Garden, I discovered the art of pruning fruit trees into arches to form shaded paths. I also learned about the Chicago Botanic Garden's plant trials aimed at guiding local homeowners to select species that thrive in Chicago's notoriously harsh climate with moderate care.

In the Rose and Heritage Garden, I had the privilege of learning about rose care and deadheading. A highlight of this experience was meeting the renowned rose breeder and rose consultant at the garden, William Radler.

In the English Walled Garden, I undertook an intensive crash course in plant recognition by labeling various plants â€“ a real game of hide and seek!

**I**'m also grateful for the unique opportunities I've had while volunteering, such as being part of the live broadcast of 'Botanic Backyard', a show offering tips and tricks to homeowners on WGN9. I was also fascinated by the computer-controlled nursery facility tour where I witnessed the staggering degree of automation controlling the temperature, humidity, and luminosity within the greenhouse.

Though I had previous beekeeping experience, capturing a swarm of bees in the wild was undoubtedly a first.

My volunteer experience at the Chicago Botanic Garden has been an incredible journey, blending the knowledge of my past with the skills of my future in enriching ways.
