Chemtrails debunk is a project I did at Adimaker. We were tasked to create a simple website to debunk a conspiracy theory. We choose to debunk the popular Chemtrail conspiracy theory, believers think that the condensation trails left by airplanes are in fact chemicals. We used scientific facts and common sense to debunk the conspiracy theory.


On a more technical note the website was built using the Tailwind CSS framework witch made the process of creating the website faster and enabling us to make it prettier easily. The website supports, light and dark mode, and is hosted on Netlify servers and is accessible [here](https://chemtrail-debunk.netlify.app/).
