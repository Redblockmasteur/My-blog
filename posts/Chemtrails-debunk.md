JUNIA is an engineering school that offers its students a foundation course to broaden their knowledge beyond their chosen field of study. As part of this course we were given the task of creating a website to debunk a conspiracy theory and we set out to debunk the popular chemtrails conspiracy theory.

The Chemtrails Debunk website was created by the students as part of their general culture course at JUNIA. We tried to use scientific facts and common sense to debunk the conspiracy theory that the contrails left behind by aircraft are actually chemicals released into the atmosphere.

The site was built using the Tailwind CSS framework, which made the process of building the site faster and allowed us to focus on the content. The site has a clean and modern design that is easy to navigate. It supports both light and dark modes, allowing users to choose the mode that is most comfortable for them.

The Chemtrails Debunk website is hosted on Netlify servers, ensuring fast loading times and reliable performance. The site is accessible to everyone ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://chemtrail-debunk.netlify.app/) and the code is hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Redblockmasteur/chemtrail_debunk).
