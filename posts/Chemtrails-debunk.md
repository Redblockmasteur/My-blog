Chemtrails debunk is a project I did at Adimaker. We were asked to create a simple website to debunk a conspiracy theory. We chose to debunk the popular chemtrail conspiracy theory, where believers think that the condensation trails left by the engines of aeroplanes are actually chemicals. We used scientific facts and common sense to debunk this conspiracy theory.

On a more technical note, the website was built using the Tailwind CSS framework, which made the process of creating the website faster and allowed us to make it more enjoyable to visit. The site supports both light and dark mode and is hosted on Netlify servers and can be accessed [here](https://chemtrail-debunk.netlify.app/).
