The SNIB (Saint Nicolas Intelligent Building), is a project composed of sensor units installed in various paces and a server running Grafana for data visualization. The sensor unit is powered by two 18650 rechargeable lithium-ion cells the data processing is handled by a Wemos D1 mini, the unit is fitted with a temperature and hygrometry sensor as well as an ambient light sensor.

The final goal of the project is to detect waste of energy like overheating or lights accidentally left running during the night. The data can also be used in order to measure the effectiveness of added insulation or new policies for example.
